## Hermes

Hermes is a small and lightweight JavaScript VM optimized for running React
Native apps on Android.  This package contains desktop binaries for testing and
development purposes:

* `hermes`, can be used as a REPL, to run bytecode, and to run/compile source code
* `hdb`, a command line debugger
* `hbcdump`, a low level bytecode inspection tool
* `hermesc`, a subset of `hermes` that only compiles source code

See [hermesengine.dev](https://hermesengine.dev) for more information.
